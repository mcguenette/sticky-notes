# sticky-notes

#### Bugs, incomplete items:
- Clicking on an existing sticky note changes the size of the container
- Forcing date of sticky note to the bottom
- Add FOCUS to new note - when title is blank or when content is blank and you click save
- Forcing the save and cancel buttons to the bottom
- Add HOVER to sidebar items to be able to select
- Make sticky notes look more like sticky notes
- HOME icon have it not switch views, only go to main view
- Content height to be full page
- Better highlight/style for colour icons, maybe change the note background color based on their selection?

#### Future features:
- Add lists, tagging system to group them up instead and show under Lists in sidebar
- Add calendar feature
  - Show notes either created on a certain day or have due date instead
